## General tips

- **Aim** &ndash; aim to write shorter sentences
- **Try** &ndash; to avoid (many, long) one-sentence paragraphs. Use shorter sentences and string 'em together!
- **Rly** &ndash; why use many word when few word do trick?

### Subheadings
- (`###` / `h3`) Are great to help with that. <br/>_Subheadings don't show up in the page-nav menu, level 2 headings (`## / h2`) do._
- **Use markdown** be generous with markup. **bold**, _emphasise_, [add classes](#what-you-need-to-know), use ALL the markup!
- **For example**: why not use a horizontal line `---` some times?
- **Eyes only** Writing lots of dry paragraphs in a row? Throw an image, code snippet or a super hot tip [using the util classes](#what-you-need-to-know) in there. Let the mind wander for a bit!

## What you need to know

In markdown, using `{:.classname}` you can add css classes to elements. 

```markdown
{:.my-class}
This will render as a paragraph with class set to "my-class"

{:.my-class}
> This will render as a blockquote with class set to "my-class"
```
## Utility classes
The docs stylesheet contains a couple of util classes to decorate elements for extra emphasis.
Add `.note` to indicate a piece of text with an icon. 

* **`.note`** &ndash; base class, adds a general note icon indicator
* `.info` adds a blue info icon
* `.comment` adds a text balloon icon
* `.warning` adds a red exclamation mark icon
* `.hint` adds an arrow icon
* `.bad` adds a red cross icon
* `.good` adss a green (ish) check icon

## Usage

Add the class `.note` to a paragraph or blockquote. 

```
{:.note}
Paragraph with note

{:.note}
> Blockquote with note
```

{:.note}
Paragraph with note

{:.note}
> Blockquote with note

Optionally extend the class with appropriate indicator:
```
{:.note.warning}
> Yeah nah yeah m8
```


{:.note.warning}
> Yeah nah yeah m8 in a block quote
